Trinity College Dublin is a sister college to St John's College, Cambridge and Oriel College, Oxford,[12][13] and by incorporation, a graduate of Dublin, Oxford or Cambridge can be conferred the equivalent degree at either of the other two without further examination.[14] The university is legally incorporated by "the Provost, Fellows, Foundation Scholars and other members of the Board," as outlined by its founding charter.[15] It is one of the seven ancient universities of Britain and Ireland,[16] as well as Ireland's oldest surviving university.[17] The university's main campus, in the heart of Dublin, has been ranked among the most iconic in the world, and is the setting for a number of novels, films and urban legends.[18][19][20]

Widely considered one of Europe's elite universities, Trinity is Ireland's most prestigious university, in part due to its historical significance.[21][22] Academically, it is divided into three faculties comprising 23 schools, offering degree and diploma courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.[23] The admission procedure is based exclusively on academic merit,[24] with the college being particularly acclaimed in law, literature and humanities.[25] It also carries out extensive research in nanotechnology, information technology, immunology, mathematics, engineering, psychology, politics and English.[26] Trinity College was originally established outside Dublin's city walls in the buildings of the outlawed Catholic Augustinian Priory of All Hallows. It was set up in part to consolidate the rule of the Tudor monarchy in Ireland, and as a result was the university of the Protestant Ascendancy for much of its history.[27] While Catholics were admitted from 1793, certain restrictions on membership of the college remained, as professorships, fellowships and scholarships were reserved for Protestants. An 1873 Act of Parliament lifted these restrictions.[28] While Catholics were not formally banned from attending Trinity at that time, Ireland's Catholic hierarchy discouraged it.[29] Women were first admitted to the college as full members in 1904.[30]
